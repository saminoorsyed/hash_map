# hash_map
This repo is an implementation of two hash tables without using python data structures except for those provided in hash_map_supp.py: one with chaining (linked lists), and one with open addressing (quadratic probing). Basic skeleton code and specifications were provided by the instructor.

This is the portfolio project for Oregon State University's Data structures class which covered the following topics: static and dynamic arrays, linked lists, common ADTs (bags, stacks, queues, dequeues), binary search trees, AVL trees, heaps, hash tables, graphs and traversals, heap sort, count sort, merge sort, and shell sort.
